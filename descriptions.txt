Iron is a mineral essential for basic body growth and functionality since it is part of your blood that transfers oxygen from your lungs to tissue. It is needed for physical growth and neurological development as well as muscle metabolism. We recommend getting iron from most lean meats, seafood, and spinach.

Fiber is a carbohydrate that your body cannot digest. There are two types of fiber: insoluble and soluable. Insoluble fiber helps prevent constipation and gut infections while soluable fiber can help lower your cholesterol as well as your blood sugar. We recommend getting insoluble fiber through fruits with skins, such as apples and pears, and uncooked vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli. For soluble fiber, we recommend oats barely, and dried beans.
